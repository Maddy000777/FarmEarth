    <h1 class="heading">About Wheat</h1>
    <p class="para">
        Wheat is the main cereal crop in India. The total area under the crop is about 29.8
        million hectares in the country. The production of wheat in the country has increased
        significantly from 75.81 million MT in 2006-07 to an all time record high of 94.88
        million MT in 2011-12. The productivity of wheat which was 2602 kg/hectare in 2004-05
        has increased to 3140 kg/hectare in 2011-12. The major increase in the productivity
        of wheat has been observed in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Higher
        area coverage is reported from MP in recent years. Indian wheat is largely a soft/medium hard, medium protein, white bread wheat, somewhat
            similar to U.S. hard white wheat. Wheat grown in central and western India is typically
            hard, with high protein and high gluten content. India also produces around 1.0-1.2
            million tons of durum wheat, mostly in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Most Indian
            durum is not marketed separately due to segregation problems in the market yards.
            However, some quantities are purchased by the private trade at a price premium,
            mainly for processing of higher value/branded products.</p>
            <p class="para1">
                The production and productivity of Wheat crop were quite low, when India became
                independent in 1947. The production of Wheat was only 6.46 million tonnes and productivity
                was merely 663 kg per hectare during 1950-51, which was not sufficient to feed the
                Indian population. The Country used to import Wheat in large quantities for fulfilling
                the needs of our people from many countries like USA under PL-480. The reasons of
                low production and productivity of Wheat at that time was (a) the tall growing plant
                habit resulting in lodging, when grown under fertile soils, (b) the poor tillering
                and low sink capacity of the varieties used, (c) higher susceptibility to diseases,
                (d) the higher sensitivity to thermo &amp; photo variations, etc., resulting in
                poor adaptability, and (e) longer crop duration resulting in a long exposure of
                plants to the climatic variations and insect pest / disease attacks.
                    The Government of India appointed a commission in 1961 to assess the feasibility
                    of increasing the crop productivity under prevailing Indian ecological conditions.
                    As result of various steps taken by Govt. of India, the Wheat scenario in our country
                    has completely changed. In the post Independence era, country used to import Wheat
                    for our needs but due to bumper increase in the production and productivity of Wheat
                    in the 'Green Revolution' period in late sixties, our country became self dependent
                    in Wheat production. At present, country is producing much more excess Wheat than
                    the requirement and Godowns are over-flooded with Wheat.</p>
